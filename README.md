This folder contains the scripts employed to perform the analysis of singlecell RNA-Seq data for the manuscript: "The Parkinson's disease associated mutation LRRK2-G2019S alters dopaminergic differentiation dynamics via NR2F1". Link to the final version of this manuscript will be added here soon, upon journal publication. The codes collected here have been developed by Stefano Magni (python custom pipeline, stefano.magni@uni.lu), Tomasz Ignac (python custom libraries), Alexander Skupin (R Monocle-based pipeline) and Luis Salamanca (MATLAB pipeline).
