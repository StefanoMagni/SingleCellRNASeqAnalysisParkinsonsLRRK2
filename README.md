# SingleCellRNASeqAnalysisParkinsonsLRRK2
This folder contains the scripts employed to perform the analysis of singlecell RNA-Seq data for the manuscript: "The Parkinson's disease associated mutation LRRK2-G2019S alters dopaminergic differentiation dynamics via NR2F1". The published version of this manuscript can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109864. The codes collected here have been developed by Stefano Magni (python custom pipeline, stefano.magni@uni.lu), Tomasz Ignac (python custom libraries), Alexander Skupin (R Monocle-based pipeline, alexander.skupin@uni.lu) and Luis Salamanca (MATLAB pipeline, luis.salamanca@sdsc.ethz.ch). We published the part of the single-cell data analysis focusing on mitochondria in a separate manuscript titled "Neural Stem Cells of Parkinson's Disease Patients Exhibit Aberrant Mitochondrial Morphology and Functionality", which can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.03.004. You are free to use our scripts and data according to the license available in the github folder. In case you do so, we would strongly appreciate if you would cite our manuscripts above as appropriate.
